        "A": "The maximum pulling tension for #10 AWG copper is approximately 200 pounds to prevent conductor damage or insulation compromise.",
        "B": "300 pounds exceeds safe pulling tension for #10 AWG and could damage the conductor.",
        "C": "400 pounds is far too high for #10 AWG and would likely damage the conductor permanently.",
