      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Proper documentation is critical for program understanding, troubleshooting, training, and future modifications. Saying documentation is unnecessary goes against industry best practice.",
        "B": "Good documentation practices include using meaningful tag names, adding rung comments to explain the purpose of the logic, documenting I/O assignments, and keeping a revision history or change log with dates and reasons for changes.",
        "C": "Cryptic tag names make the program hard to read and maintain. Descriptive names improve understanding and reduce troubleshooting time.",
        "D": "While code shows what the PLC does, it does not clearly explain the intent, assumptions, or design decisions. Comments and documentation are essential to communicate the logic to other technicians and engineers."

        "A": "Weighing scale programming",

        "D": "Analog scaling is automatic"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Scaling is mathematical conversion, not weight measurement programming.",
        "B": "Analog scaling converts: raw input counts (0-4095, 0-32767) to engineering units (0-100°C, 0-250 PSI) using formulas, or engineering values to output counts (4-20mA, 0-10V).",
        "C": "Scaling is required translating between PLC digital representation and real-world analog values.",
        "D": "While some modules have scaling configuration, programming often includes explicit scaling calculations."

      "options": {
        "A": "Personal identification",
        "B": "Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm controlling process variables to setpoints by calculating error correction",

        "D": "PID is manual control only"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "PID is the acronym for a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control algorithm, not for a personal identification system.",
        "B": "PID control uses three terms: Proportional (immediate response to error), Integral (eliminates steady-state error), Derivative (anticipates future error), controlling temperature, pressure, flow, level.",
        "C": "In fact, PID is a standard PLC function block/instruction used for closed-loop process control applications, so it is used in PLCs.",
        "D": "PID is not manual control. It is an automatic closed-loop control algorithm that continuously adjusts the output to maintain the process variable at the setpoint."
