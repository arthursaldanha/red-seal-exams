      "options": {
        "A": "The color of the grinding wheel",
        "B": "Wheel specification including abrasive type, grit size, grade, and bond type matched to material hardness and application requirements",

        "D": "The weight of the grinding wheel"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Wheel color is typically for identification purposes and doesn't indicate performance characteristics. Color doesn't determine cutting ability, material compatibility, or safety requirements.",
        "B": "Grinding wheel selection requires matching: abrasive type (aluminum oxide for steel, silicon carbide for non-ferrous), grit size (coarse for heavy stock removal, fine for finishing), grade (soft for hard materials, hard for soft materials), bond type (vitrified, resinoid, rubber) to application. Proper selection ensures efficient cutting, good surface finish, and safe operation.",
        "C": "While cost is a consideration, selecting wheels based solely on price ignores critical safety and performance factors. Improper wheels cause poor results, excessive wear, and potential safety hazards including wheel breakage.",
        "D": "Wheel weight is incidental to its construction and not a selection criterion. Performance characteristics (abrasive, grit, grade, bond) determine suitability for specific materials and operations, not physical weight."

      "question": "What type of cutting blade is most appropriate for cutting stainless steel with a portable bandsaw?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Standard carbon steel blade",
        "B": "Bi-metal blade with high-speed steel teeth or carbide-tipped blade designed for stainless steel; finer tooth pitch (10-14 TPI) for thin sections, coarser (6-10 TPI) for thick sections",
        "C": "Wood cutting blade",
        "D": "Masonry cutting blade"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Carbon steel blades wear rapidly when cutting stainless steel due to the material's work-hardening characteristics and toughness. The blade dulls quickly, produces poor cuts, and overheats. Not suitable for stainless applications.",
        "B": "Stainless steel cutting requires: bi-metal blades combining flexible backing with high-speed steel teeth (HSS) for wear resistance, or carbide-tipped blades for extended life, appropriate tooth pitch based on section thickness (10-14 TPI for thin wall tubing, 6-10 TPI for heavy sections), slower cutting speed than carbon steel. Proper blade selection ensures clean cuts and acceptable blade life in tough stainless steel.",
        "C": "Wood cutting blades have completely incompatible tooth geometry, materials, and design. They would fail instantly when attempting to cut metal, creating dangerous conditions and destroying the blade.",
        "D": "Masonry blades are designed for concrete, brick, and stone using diamond or abrasive segments. They're incompatible with metal cutting requiring different tooth design and cannot effectively cut stainless steel."

      "question": "What is the correct blade speed (surface feet per minute) for cutting mild steel on a horizontal bandsaw?",
      "options": {
        "A": "500-800 SFPM is too fast for steel",
        "B": "80-150 SFPM for mild steel; harder steels require slower speeds (60-90 SFPM); softer materials like aluminum use faster speeds (200-350 SFPM)",
        "C": "1000+ SFPM for all metals",
        "D": "Blade speed doesn't affect cutting quality"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "500-800 SFPM is excessive for cutting steel causing rapid blade wear, overheating, tooth stripping, and poor cut quality. These speeds might be appropriate for very soft materials but are far too fast for ferrous metals.",
        "B": "Mild steel cutting speeds: 80-150 SFPM (surface feet per minute) provides optimal cutting efficiency and blade life, harder alloy steels require slower speeds (60-90 SFPM) preventing excessive heat and tooth wear, softer materials like aluminum allow faster speeds (200-350 SFPM), stainless steel typically uses 60-100 SFPM due to work hardening. Proper speed selection balances productivity with blade life.",
        "C": "1000+ SFPM would instantly destroy blades when cutting metals causing tooth stripping, extreme heat buildup, and blade failure. Such high speeds are only suitable for very soft materials or specialized cutting applications.",
        "D": "Blade speed critically affects: cutting quality, blade life, heat generation, surface finish, cutting accuracy. Incorrect speeds cause premature blade failure, poor cuts, and potential safety hazards. Speed must be matched to material."

      "question": "What indicates proper blade tension on a horizontal bandsaw?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Blade tension is unimportant",
        "B": "Proper tension produces straight, accurate cuts without blade wandering or twisting; typically 15,000-30,000 PSI depending on blade width and material; insufficient tension causes blade deflection and crooked cuts",
        "C": "Maximum possible tension is always best",
        "D": "Visual appearance of blade sag is the only indicator"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Blade tension is critical for cutting accuracy and blade performance. Improper tension causes: blade wandering producing crooked cuts, premature blade failure, poor surface finish, excessive blade wear. Correct tension is essential.",
        "B": "Proper blade tension: enables straight accurate cuts without blade deflection, prevents blade twisting or wandering in the cut, typically ranges 15,000-30,000 PSI depending on blade width and backing material, verified using tension gauge on saw, insufficient tension causes blade to deflect producing angled or curved cuts, excessive tension causes premature blade fatigue and breakage. Manufacturers specify proper tension for each blade type.",
        "C": "Excessive tension causes: premature blade fatigue and cracking, stress on saw frame and bearings, potential blade breakage during operation. Tension must be within manufacturer's specifications, not arbitrarily maximized.",
        "D": "While visual sag indicates gross under-tension, proper tension requires gauge measurement to manufacturer specifications. Visual assessment alone doesn't verify tension is within the correct range for accurate cutting and optimal blade life."

      "question": "What is the maximum thickness capacity that should be cut with hydraulic shears?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Any thickness can be cut regardless of machine capacity",
        "B": "Never exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity for the specific material being cut; capacity varies with material tensile strength (lower capacity for high-strength steels); attempting to exceed capacity damages machine and creates safety hazards",
        "C": "Visual judgment determines cutting capacity",
        "D": "Shear capacity is the same for all materials"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Exceeding machine capacity causes: machine damage (bent frame, damaged blades, hydraulic system failure), poor cut quality, safety hazards from machine failure or material kickback. Capacity limits must be strictly observed.",
        "B": "Shear capacity considerations: manufacturer specifies maximum thickness for mild steel (baseline capacity), capacity reduces for higher-strength materials (stainless steel, hardened steel) due to greater shearing force required, capacity chart should be consulted for specific materials, attempting to exceed capacity damages shear components and creates dangerous conditions, material must be securely supported and properly positioned. Never exceed rated capacity.",
        "C": "Visual judgment cannot accurately determine if material thickness exceeds machine capacity. Material must be measured and compared to manufacturer's capacity chart for the specific material grade being cut.",
        "D": "Shear capacity varies significantly with material properties. High-strength steels, stainless steel, and hardened materials require more shearing force than mild steel, reducing effective capacity. Capacity charts account for material strength differences."

      "options": {
        "A": "Back gauge is purely decorative",
        "B": "Back gauge provides reference surface for positioning material at specific distance from blade, enabling: accurate repetitive cuts to specified dimensions, parallel edges, consistent strip width cutting, precise positioning without measuring each piece",
        "C": "Back gauge prevents operator from getting too close",
        "D": "Back gauge is used for material storage"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Back gauge serves critical functional purposes ensuring dimensional accuracy and productivity. It's a precision reference system, not decorative equipment.",
        "B": "Back gauge functions: provides adjustable reference surface parallel to cutting blade, positions material at precise distance from cut line, enables accurate repetitive cuts without individual measurement, ensures parallel edges on strip cutting, improves productivity by eliminating layout for repetitive cuts, graduated scale or digital readout shows distance setting. Essential for production cutting and dimensional accuracy.",
        "C": "While back gauge does provide physical barrier, its primary purpose is dimensional control and positioning accuracy, not operator protection. Guard systems provide operator protection.",
        "D": "Back gauge is precision positioning device, not storage. It maintains specific distance relationship to blade enabling accurate cuts. Material is supported on shear table, not stored on back gauge."

      "question": "What is the correct technique for using a hand file on metal?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Push and pull strokes with equal pressure",
        "B": "Apply pressure on forward stroke only; lift slightly on return stroke preventing teeth from dulling; file perpendicular to work or at slight angle; use full length of file; clean frequently with file card",
        "C": "Maximum pressure on both strokes for faster cutting",
        "D": "File in circular motions for best results"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Pressure on return stroke causes file teeth to rub rather than cut, dulling the file prematurely and loading teeth with chips. Files are designed to cut on forward stroke only.",
        "B": "Proper filing technique: apply pressure on forward stroke when teeth engage and cut material, lift file slightly on return stroke protecting teeth and preventing dulling, hold file perpendicular to work or at slight angle for cross-filing, use full length of file for even wear, clean regularly with file card removing loaded chips, proper technique extends file life and produces smooth accurate surfaces.",
        "C": "Excessive pressure damages file teeth, causes file to chatter producing rough surface, increases fatigue, and reduces control. Moderate steady pressure on forward stroke provides better cutting and surface finish.",
        "D": "Circular filing motion produces uneven surfaces, doesn't utilize file teeth effectively, and makes dimensional control difficult. Files are designed for straight strokes across the work surface."

      "question": "What safety precaution must be observed when using a cold chisel?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Safety glasses are optional for chisel work",
        "B": "Wear safety glasses with side shields, inspect chisel for mushroomed head before use, grind off mushroomed edges preventing flying metal fragments, secure work in vise, keep chisel sharp, strike squarely with appropriate hammer",
        "C": "Mushroomed chisel heads are acceptable and don't require attention",
        "D": "Any hammer size works equally well with chisels"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Safety glasses are mandatory for chisel work. Flying metal chips from cutting and fragments from mushroomed heads cause serious eye injuries. Side shields provide protection from angular fragments. Required PPE.",
        "B": "Cold chisel safety: always wear safety glasses with side shields (flying metal chips and fragments), inspect chisel head for mushrooming before each use, grind mushroomed heads preventing metal fragments breaking off when struck, secure work firmly in vise preventing movement, maintain sharp cutting edge for efficient cutting, use ball peen hammer of appropriate size (too light is ineffective, too heavy causes mushrooming). Systematic safety prevents injuries.",
        "C": "Mushroomed chisel heads are dangerous: fragments break off when struck creating flying metal hazards, reduced striking surface causes missed blows, indicates fatigue and potential chisel failure. Mushroomed heads must be ground off regularly.",
        "D": "Hammer must be appropriate size for chisel: too light is ineffective requiring excessive strikes, too heavy causes rapid mushrooming of chisel head and operator fatigue. Typically ball peen hammer 1.5-2 lbs for standard chisels."

      "question": "What is the correct operating speed for a portable grinder with a 4.5-inch grinding wheel?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Grinder speed is unimportant",
        "B": "Never exceed maximum RPM marked on grinding wheel; typical 4.5-inch grinders operate at 10,000-13,000 RPM; verify grinder speed matches or is lower than wheel's maximum rated RPM before use; exceeding rated speed causes wheel failure and serious injury",
        "C": "Always operate at maximum possible RPM regardless of wheel rating",
        "D": "Use lowest speed setting for all applications"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Operating speed is critical safety factor. Exceeding wheel's maximum rated RPM causes centrifugal forces to break wheel apart creating flying debris causing severe injury or death. Speed matching is mandatory.",
        "B": "Grinding wheel speed safety: every grinding wheel has maximum safe RPM marked on wheel or blotter, typical 4.5-inch (115mm) angle grinders run 10,000-13,000 RPM, grinder spindle speed must not exceed wheel's maximum rated RPM, verify compatibility before mounting wheel, exceeding rated speed causes catastrophic wheel failure with deadly consequences. Always match or operate below wheel's rated speed.",
        "C": "Operating above wheel's rated RPM is extremely dangerous causing wheel to explode from centrifugal forces. This is leading cause of grinding wheel fatalities. Speed must always be at or below wheel's maximum rating.",
        "D": "While operating below maximum is safe, excessively low speeds reduce grinding efficiency. Optimal speed is typically near wheel's maximum rating (but never exceeding it) providing best cutting action and productivity."

      "question": "What is the correct angle to hold a portable angle grinder when grinding or cutting?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Grinder angle doesn't affect results or safety",
        "B": "For grinding: 15-30° angle to surface; for cutting: 90° perpendicular to material; maintain consistent angle avoiding excessive pressure; let wheel do the work; never use side of cutting wheel for grinding",
        "C": "Hold grinder flat against surface at all times",
        "D": "Angle changes randomly during operation"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Grinder angle significantly affects: cutting/grinding efficiency, wheel wear pattern, surface finish, safety (binding, kickback). Proper angle is essential for effective safe operation.",
        "B": "Grinding angle requirements: for surface grinding use 15-30° angle allowing wheel to contact workpiece across face, for cutting with cutoff wheel maintain 90° perpendicular angle to material, consistent angle prevents wheel binding and kickback, moderate pressure allowing wheel to cut (excessive pressure causes glazing, breakage, kickback), never use side of thin cutoff wheel for grinding (causes wheel breakage). Proper technique ensures safety and effectiveness.",
        "C": "Holding grinding wheel completely flat against surface concentrates forces improperly causing wheel damage and poor grinding action. Slight angle distributes force across wheel face for effective grinding.",
        "D": "Angle must be deliberately controlled and consistent. Random angle changes cause: poor surface finish, uneven wheel wear, potential binding and kickback, loss of dimensional control. Operator maintains consistent appropriate angle throughout operation."

      "options": {
        "A": "Grit size indicates wheel color",
        "B": "Grit size indicates abrasive particle size: higher numbers mean finer particles (100-220 grit for finishing), lower numbers mean coarser particles (24-60 grit for heavy stock removal); selection depends on desired surface finish and material removal rate",
        "C": "All grit sizes perform identically",
        "D": "Grit size indicates wheel diameter"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Grit size is not related to color. It's a standardized numerical indicator of abrasive particle size affecting cutting action and surface finish produced. Color may indicate abrasive type, not grit.",
        "B": "Grit size meaning: numerical value indicates abrasive particle size, higher numbers represent smaller particles producing finer finish (100-220 grit for surface finishing, deburring, blending), lower numbers represent larger particles for aggressive stock removal (24-60 grit for heavy grinding, weld removal), medium grits (60-100) for general purpose work. Proper grit selection balances material removal rate with desired surface finish.",
        "C": "Grit sizes perform very differently: coarse grit removes material quickly but leaves rough surface, fine grit produces smooth finish but removes material slowly. Application determines appropriate grit selection.",
        "D": "Wheel diameter is separate specification measured in inches or millimeters. Grit size indicates abrasive particle size, not wheel physical dimensions. Both are important specifications but measure different properties."

        "C": "Any grinding wheel works on carbide",
        "D": "Wood sanding discs"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Aluminum oxide wheels wear extremely rapidly when grinding carbide due to the material's extreme hardness (comparable to aluminum oxide itself). The wheel loads and glazes quickly becoming ineffective. Inappropriate for carbide.",
        "B": "Carbide grinding requires: silicon carbide abrasive which is harder and more friable than aluminum oxide, green silicon carbide is specifically formulated for carbide grinding, diamond wheels provide maximum life and best results for production grinding, aluminum oxide wears too quickly due to carbide's extreme hardness. Proper abrasive selection ensures effective grinding without excessive wheel consumption.",
        "C": "Carbide's extreme hardness (Rc 70-80+) requires specific abrasive types. Standard aluminum oxide wheels are ineffective wearing rapidly and glazing. Only silicon carbide or diamond effectively grind carbide materials.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While blades eventually wear out, premature tooth breakage results from operational factors: improper speed, excessive feed, wrong tooth pitch, poor technique. Age-related wear is gradual, not sudden tooth breakage.",
        "B": "Tooth breakage causes: excessive feed pressure overloading teeth, blade speed too fast for material causing heat and tooth failure, blade pitch too fine for thick sections (need 3+ teeth in contact with material), hitting hard mill scale or inclusions in material, improper cut starting technique, machine vibration from worn bearings or loose components. Proper operating parameters and technique prevent premature failure.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Material support is critical for: cut quality, blade life, operator safety, dimensional accuracy. Unsupported material deflects during cutting causing multiple problems. Support is essential for quality shearing.",
        "B": "Long cut material support: use roller stands or support tables on both sides of shear supporting material, prevents material from sagging or falling creating binding in cut, unsupported weight causes blade deflection producing poor cut quality, falling material creates safety hazards and potential injuries, support maintains material flat to table preventing angular cuts, especially critical for large sheets and heavy plate. Proper support ensures quality cuts and safety.",

        "B": "Thin-wall tubing blade selection: use fine pitch 24-32 TPI blade ensuring multiple teeth (minimum 3) contact material simultaneously, multiple tooth contact distributes cutting forces preventing individual tooth breakage, finer pitch produces smoother cuts on thin materials, prevents teeth from catching and stripping on thin sections. Rule: at least 3 teeth must be in contact with material being cut.",
        "C": "Tooth pitch is critical for successful cutting: too coarse causes tooth breakage and rough cuts, too fine causes slow cutting and blade clogging. Proper pitch selection based on material thickness ensures effective cutting and blade life.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Propane produces cooler flame than acetylene (5720°F vs 6300°F) making it slower for cutting. While economical and suitable for heating and heavy plate cutting, it's not the most common cutting fuel. Acetylene dominates precision cutting applications.",
        "B": "Fuel gas selection: acetylene (C₂H₂) most common for cutting due to hottest flame temperature 6300°F enabling fastest cutting speeds, produces cleanest cuts with minimal dross, most versatile for various thicknesses, propane economical for preheating and heavy cutting but slower than acetylene, MAPP/MPS (methylacetylene-propadiene) intermediate temperature and cost, natural gas mainly for heating not precision cutting. Acetylene standard for quality production cutting.",
        "C": "Natural gas produces relatively cool flame (~4600°F) making it ineffective for cutting. Used primarily for heating and brazing, not precision cutting operations. Too slow for production cutting requirements.",

        "A": "Piercing requires different technique than edge starting. Molten metal erupts upward when cutting oxygen applied in middle of plate. Torch must be raised and technique modified preventing tip damage and ensuring successful piercing.",
        "B": "Piercing technique: position torch above normal cutting height (1 to 2 times normal distance), preheat spot until bright red/orange ignition temperature, gradually squeeze cutting oxygen valve, simultaneously raise torch height to avoid molten metal eruption, maintain cutting oxygen until completely through thickness, lower torch to normal cutting height, begin travel in desired direction. Raised height prevents tip damage from erupting molten metal during initial piercing.",

Corrections: reduce preheat flame size, increase tip standoff slightly, optimize travel speed faster, maintain perpendicular torch angle, verify adequate cutting oxygen pressure. Technique optimization minimizes edge melting.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Hose diameter is arbitrary and doesn't matter",

        "A": "Hose diameter critically affects oxygen flow capacity and pressure delivery. Undersized cutting oxygen hoses cause pressure drop reducing cutting performance. Diameter must match flow requirements for proper operation.",
        "B": "Cutting oxygen hose sizing: cutting oxygen volume flow much greater than preheat oxygen (cutting stream does the work), larger diameter (1/4\" or 5/16\" ID) maintains pressure and flow over hose length without excessive pressure drop, prevents velocity loss affecting cutting oxygen jet effectiveness, preheat oxygen can use smaller diameter (3/16\" ID) due to lower flow requirements. Proper sizing ensures adequate cutting oxygen delivery maintaining pressure and velocity for effective cutting.",

        "B": "CAC-A electrical safety: operates at relatively high voltage (open circuit 60-80V) compared to some welding processes, current of 300-600+ amps creates dangerous shock potential, wet conditions (sweaty clothing, damp floors) dramatically increase shock risk, torch must have good insulation, operator must wear dry gloves and clothing, avoid simultaneous contact with electrode and workpiece or ground, stand on dry non-conductive surface, electrode holder must be well-insulated. High power creates serious shock potential requiring comprehensive electrical safety practices.",
        "C": "Dangerous electrical shock can occur below 100 volts especially with high current. 60-80V at hundreds of amperes is dangerous particularly in wet conditions or with body contact across heart. Voltage isn't only shock hazard factor.",
