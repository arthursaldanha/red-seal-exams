      "explanations": {
        "A": "Length verification is separate from cut quality inspection; end condition affects joint integrity regardless of length.",
        "B": "Square cuts ensure proper fitting engagement, while deburring prevents flow restriction, turbulence, and gasket damage.",
        "C": "Tool type is less important than the quality of the resulting cut; various tools can produce acceptable cuts if used properly.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Compression fittings require undamaged ferrules of correct size to create leak-free seals; missing or damaged ferrules will cause leaks.",
        "B": "Compression fittings should not be reused as ferrules deform during initial installation and will not seal properly if reinstalled.",
        "C": "Manufacturing date is not a primary inspection concern for fittings; physical condition and proper components are critical.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Surface dirt is easily cleaned and does not indicate material degradation or affect pipe integrity.",
        "B": "UV exposure causes surface chalking, brittleness, discoloration, and cracking in plastics, compromising strength and requiring rejection.",
        "C": "Condensation is a temporary environmental condition unrelated to UV damage or pipe integrity.",
        "D": "While faded labels may indicate UV exposure, the critical factor is physical degradation of the pipe material itself."

        "A": "Color coding helps identification but does not determine pressure capability; marked ratings are the definitive specification.",
        "B": "Pipe pressure rating must meet or exceed system design pressure to prevent failure; using under-rated pipe creates dangerous conditions.",
        "C": "Manufacturing location is irrelevant provided materials meet specifications and standards; ratings determine suitability.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While excessive force can damage the wheel, the primary concern is tubing deformation affecting joint quality.",
        "B": "Over-tightening causes tubing to deform and creates an internal lip (roll) that restricts flow and must be reamed out.",
        "C": "Gradual tightening actually produces better cuts than aggressive tightening; speed is not improved by over-tightening.",
        "D": "Noise reduction is not a factor in proper cutting technique; preventing deformation is the critical concern."
