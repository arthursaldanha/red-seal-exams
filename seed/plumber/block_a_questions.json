        "B": "A minimum clearance of 3 meters (10 feet) is typically required when working with conductive materials near overhead power lines to prevent electrical contact.",
        "C": "While 5 meters provides extra safety margin, it exceeds the standard minimum requirement and may not be practical in all situations.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Many atmospheric hazards are invisible and odorless, making visual assessment inadequate for determining safe entry conditions.",
        "B": "Relying on odor detection is unreliable as many toxic gases are odorless or cause olfactory fatigue.",
        "C": "Atmospheric testing must be conducted before each entry and monitored continuously as conditions can change rapidly within confined spaces.",
        "D": "Once-daily testing is insufficient as atmospheric conditions in confined spaces can deteriorate quickly due to work activities or external factors."

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While thermal expansion can occur, the immediate danger from heating PVC is the toxic gas release, not mechanical failure.",
        "B": "When PVC is heated, it releases highly toxic gases including hydrogen chloride and potentially phosgene, posing serious respiratory hazards.",
        "C": "PVC is flame-retardant and does not readily support combustion, though it will decompose and release toxic fumes when exposed to flame.",
        "D": "Structural collapse is not the primary concern with PVC exposure to heat; toxic gas generation occurs well before structural failure."
