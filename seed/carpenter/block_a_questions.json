      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Pneumatic tools do not use batteries; they operate on compressed air, making battery life irrelevant.",
        "B": "While noise is a concern requiring hearing protection, it is not the primary safety hazard specific to nail gun operation.",
        "C": "Accidental discharge is the most serious safety risk with pneumatic nail guns, potentially causing severe injuries. Tools must always be pointed at the work surface and trigger discipline maintained.",
        "D": "Though ergonomics matter, the immediate danger of unintended fastener discharge poses greater risk than tool weight."

      "options": {
        "A": "Start the saw with the blade touching the material",
        "B": "Retract the lower guard, position the front of the base plate on the work, then lower the spinning blade into the cut",
        "C": "Use the highest speed setting available",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Starting a saw with the blade in contact with material can cause kickback and loss of control, creating a dangerous situation.",
        "B": "For plunge cuts, the guard is retracted, the base plate is firmly positioned, and the running blade is carefully lowered into the material while maintaining control.",
        "C": "Speed setting should match the material being cut; highest speed is not always appropriate and doesn't address plunge cut technique.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "This pressure is too low for most framing nailers and would result in insufficient driving force for fasteners.",
        "B": "Most pneumatic framing nailers operate optimally between 70-120 PSI, providing adequate driving power while preventing over-penetration and material damage.",
        "C": "This pressure range is excessive for standard framing work and may cause fastener over-penetration or tool damage.",

        "C": "While metal cutting blades can cut nails, they cut wood inefficiently and are not optimized for demolition work with mixed materials.",

        "A": "Anti-kickback devices are safety features and do not increase cutting speed; they may actually slightly reduce feed rate.",
        "B": "Anti-kickback pawls grip the workpiece and prevent it from being violently thrown backward if the blade binds, protecting the operator from serious injury.",
        "C": "This feature has no effect on blade sharpness or longevity; it is purely a safety mechanism.",
        "D": "Both anti-kickback pawls and riving knives serve complementary safety functions and should be used together, not as replacements for each other."

      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "This extension is insufficient and may cause burning, inefficient cutting, and increased kickback risk.",
        "B": "While closer to correct, this measurement doesn't account for varying tooth heights on different blades.",
        "C": "The blade should extend approximately one full tooth height above the workpiece, providing efficient cutting while minimizing exposed blade and reducing kickback potential.",
        "D": "Excessive blade exposure increases danger from accidental contact and does not improve cutting performance."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Featherboards are not measuring devices; they are safety and accuracy aids during cutting operations.",
        "B": "Featherboards apply consistent pressure to hold material against the fence and table, preventing lifting and sideways movement for safer, more accurate cuts.",
        "C": "While featherboards may be near dust collection areas, their purpose is workpiece control, not dust management.",
        "D": "Outfeed tables or roller stands support long pieces; featherboards provide lateral and downward pressure for control."

        "C": "Upward from the table",
        "D": "Direction doesn't matter"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "This direction would pull the workpiece away from the fence, causing dangerous movement and inaccurate cuts.",
        "B": "The blade should rotate so it pulls the workpiece toward the fence, holding it securely during the cut and preventing workpiece movement.",
        "C": "Upward rotation would lift the workpiece off the table, creating a highly dangerous condition.",
        "D": "Blade rotation direction is critical for safety and must always pull material toward the fence and down to the table."

        "A": "This distance is dangerously close to the cutterhead and provides inadequate safety margin.",
        "B": "While better than 50 mm, this distance is still too close for safe jointer operation.",
        "C": "Hands should be kept at least 150 mm (6 in.) from the cutterhead, and push blocks or push sticks should be used when working closer.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While important, blade depth is a standard feature on many saws and not unique to panel saw safety.",
        "B": "The vertical sliding carriage with adequate panel support prevents large sheets from tipping or binding, which is the primary safety concern when cutting full sheets.",
        "C": "Most panel saws operate at fixed speeds appropriate for sheet goods; variable speed is not a primary safety feature.",
        "D": "Laser guides improve accuracy but are not safety features; proper material support prevents dangerous situations."

        "C": "Purple loads (medium-high power) are commonly used for concrete applications, providing sufficient force without excessive power that could cause spalling.",

        "C": "Shaking the tool could trigger a delayed ignition and cause serious injury; the tool must remain pointed at work surface.",
