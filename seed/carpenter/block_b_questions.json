      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Site layout is shown on site plans, not section drawings which focus on vertical construction details.",
        "B": "Section drawings show a vertical slice through the building, revealing wall assemblies, floor/ceiling construction, foundation details, and vertical relationships between building elements.",
        "C": "Three-dimensional views are shown in isometric or perspective drawings, not sections which are two-dimensional cuts.",

        "A": "This would be correct if the scale were 1\" = 1'-0\", but the actual scale is 1/4\" = 1'-0\".",
        "B": "This incorrectly applies a 2:1 conversion; the proper scale ratio must be calculated correctly.",
        "C": "At 1/4\" = 1'-0\" scale, each 1/4\" represents 1 foot. Therefore 3\" ÷ 0.25\" = 12, so the wall is 12 feet long.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While 'finish' is part of the term, F.F. specifically refers to floor elevation, not general finishes.",
        "B": "Front face is not a standard abbreviation; F.F. relates to elevation datums, not building faces.",

        "C": "While economy is considered, safety requirements must be met regardless of cost.",
        "D": "Finish application is separate from layout; spacing is primarily a safety issue."

        "A": "All balusters are the same length",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "On sloped railings, progressive height change means each baluster is different length.",
        "B": "Sloped railings require laying out each baluster individually as lengths progressively change to maintain plumb while following the sloped handrail.",
        "C": "Railing slope directly affects baluster length calculations; it's a critical layout factor.",
