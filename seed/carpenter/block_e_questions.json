      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "While shims may fill gaps, their primary purpose is structural alignment, not aesthetics",
        "B": "Shimming ensures the frame is plumb, level, and square while preventing distortion when fastened, which is critical for proper door operation",
        "C": "Insulation is placed around the frame; shims serve a different structural purpose",
        "D": "Trim attachment is secondary to the structural alignment function of shims"
